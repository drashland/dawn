## Why Use Sinco?

Sinco is a first of it's kind for Deno, allowing you, the developer, to test the
UI and UX of your web apps. Sinco provides many utilities to do so, and doesn't
require any npm modules or the `--unstable` flag, it is simply an API wrapper
around headless chrome.

Sinco takes concepts from the following:

* <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/dusk" target="_BLANK">Laravel Dusk</a> &mdash; taking inspiration from the methods the Dusk API provides</a>
* <a href="https://cypress.io" target="_BLANK">Cypress.io</a> &mdash; taking inspiration from the GUI</a>
